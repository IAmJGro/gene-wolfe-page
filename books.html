                <p>A stylistically diverse collection of three interconnected Novellas, <strong>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</strong> explores themes of post-colonialism and identity (in a very literal manner) in a science-fiction setting. By no means easy, but a great gateway to the worlds of Gene Wolfe.</p>

                <p>Wolfe excels in both the short form and the long. <strong>The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories</strong> is a collection of his short fiction from the 70s to early 80s. Arguably still his best collection, and a strong introductory work for the new reader.</p>

                <p>The first of three series in Wolfe's magnum opus, the Solar Cycle, <strong>The Book of the New Sun</strong> encompasses five books - a tetralogy and a coda. The story of Severian the torturer features meticulously crafted prose, wild creativity, and people, places, and events that are not what they seem on the first, second, or even third reading. Severian will quickly tell you he has a perfect memory, but is less forthcoming with the fact that he's not always telling the truth.</p>

                <p>The second segment of the Solar Cycle, <strong>The Book of the Long Sun</strong> at first appears far removed from the setting, tone, and concerns of its predecessor. In some ways, that is an accurate impression. But the links between the series become more apparent as you dig deeper. As with almost all of Wolfe's work, there is always a storyteller, and the story is more nuanced and complicated than they first appear.</p>

                <p><strong>The Book of the Short Sun</strong>is more straightforwardly linked to the Long Sun than it was to the New Sun. However, it is also the most intertextual of the group, drawing together ideas and stories from its two predecessors. Beautiful and satisfying story that amply repays the work a reader puts into it and the nine books that came before it.</p>

                <a href="https://www.portersquarebooks.com/book/9780765334565"><img src="images/peace.jpg"></a>
                <p><strong>Peace</strong> is one of Wolfe's most difficult and beguiling novels. It will have less immediate appeal to fans of speculative fiction, but trust that it is still in genre. An unnerving singleton that rewards you for the work you put into reading it.</p>
