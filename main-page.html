            <h2>His work.</h2>
            <p class="quote">"There are wolves in there, prowling behind the words. Sometimes they come out in the pages. Sometimes they wait until you close the book. The musky wolf-smell can sometimes be masked by the aromatic scent of rosemary. Understand, these are not today-wolves, slinking grayly in packs through deserted places. These are the dire-wolves of old, huge and solitary wolves that could stand their ground against grizzles." - Neil Gaiman</p>

            <p class="quote">"There was a time that she did not remember my name or that we were married, but she still remembered that she loved me." - Gene Wolfe, on his wife Rosemary before her passing.</p>

            <h2>In memoriam.</h2>
            <p class="quote">"Memory is all we have. The present is a knife's edge, adn teh future doesn't really exist.... So memory's ability to reconnect us with the past or some version of the past, is all we have." - Gene Wolfe</p>
