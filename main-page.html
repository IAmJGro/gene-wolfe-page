                <h1>Gene Wolfe: A Memory</h1>
                <h2>His work.</h2>
                <p class="quote">"There are wolves in there, prowling behind the words. Sometimes they come out in the pages. Sometimes they wait until you close the book. The musky wolf-smell can sometimes be masked by the aromatic scent of rosemary. Understand, these are not today-wolves, slinking grayly in packs through deserted places. These are the dire-wolves of old, huge and solitary wolves that could stand their ground against grizzles." - Neil Gaiman</p>
                <p>Gene Wolfe was a speculative fiction author whose works defy ready classification or explanation. They bear as close a resemblance to modernist literature or magic realism as they did to Asimov or Tolkien. Meticulously crafted and rarely what they seem at first blush, his stories reward close -- and repeated -- readings. Wolfe is most famous for the "Solar Cycle," a group of three series he published over the course of twenty years: The five-book (including its coda) <strong>The Book of the New Sun</strong>, the four-book <strong>The Book of the Long Sun</strong>, and the three-book <strong>The Book of the Short Sun</strong>. He also wrote a number of outstanding single novels and shorter works, including the novel <strong>Peace</strong>, the novella collection <strong>the Fifth Head of Cerberus</strong>, and innumerous short stories.</p>

                <p>Gene Wolfe's stories draw on diverse settings, characters, ideas, and themes. Some recurring motifs and concerns include memory, subjectivity, faith, and the influence of a narrator. In addition, most of his books are, to at least some degree, a puzzle box, in which the reader is challenged to look beyond the surface and figure out what doesn't line up. By taking those pieces and realigning them, one can find a deeper story, one that the narrator may not want them to know.</p>
                <h2>Transformations.</h2>
                <p class="quote">"There was a time that she did not remember my name or that we were married, but she still remembered that she loved me." - Gene Wolfe, on his wife Rosemary before her passing.</p>
                <p>One of the most inspiring things about Gene Wolfe is that writing was very much a second career for him. While you may or may not be familiar with his works as an author, you are very likely familiar with his works as an engineer. Wolfe was responsible for engineering the method for cooking Pringles before he was a widely published author. (It is also a good reminder that there are unsung heroes performing technical work behind almost every aspect of our society. Were Gene Wolfe not an author, the face behind his most popular work would remain unknown.)</p>
                <p>Wolfe did not succeed in getting one of his stories published until he was in his late 30s. His most acclaimed work, <strong>The Book of the New Sun</strong> was published in his late 40s and early fifties. His mid-career change between fields not traditionally thought of us as adjacent underscores the ingenuity and capacity for growth we maintain throughout our lives. But his work as an author also bespeaks the cross-pollination between such changes can bring. Wolfe approaches stories both as a poet and as an engineer, crafting sentences like chemical reactions and stories like a full chain of reactions that the reader must reverse engineer.</p>
                <h2>In memoriam.</h2>
                <p class="quote">"Memory is all we have. The present is a knife's edge, and the future doesn't really exist.... So memory's ability to reconnect us with the past or some version of the past, is all we have." - Gene Wolfe</p>
                <p>Wolfe passed away in 2019, following his wife of more than fifty years, Rosemary, who passed in 2014. By committing so much of himself to writing, Wolfe crystallized the thing with which he was fixated: memories. Not just his own memories, interpreted through the lens of fiction, but also the collective memories of everyone who experienced his works. This page and its companions are a reflection of just a few of those memories.</p>
